# Displaying Data

I know how to user:
* interpolation with double curly braces to display a component property.
* ngFor to display a list of items.
* a Typescript class to shape the model data for our component and display properties of that model.
* ngIf to conditionally display a chunk of HTML based on a boolean expression.
